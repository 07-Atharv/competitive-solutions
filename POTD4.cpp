// The problem is about we have given the specific position x and y at that position 1 is assigned and we have to fill the  2d matrix in minimum iterations
// So basically we are going to use the BFS approach for the whole matrix to make the positions 1 with min iterations and return the iteration
// we are going to use the queue data structure and then we are going to store the coordinates next we are going to use the booleab=n array to keep the track of the visited nodes
// Trverse the queue till the queue is not empty and till the end of the queue
// take an integer array which is going to store the current coordinate from the queue
